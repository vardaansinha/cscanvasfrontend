# CS Canvas Frontend

## Overview
The CS Canvas Frontend is part of a full-stack application designed to organize computer science curriculum, coursework, and grading. This project was developed by a team of three individuals and includes features such as linear regression models to simulate the unique computer science grading system at Del Norte.

## Features
- **Full-Stack Application**: Developed a full-stack application meant to organize computer science curriculum, coursework, and grading.
- **Linear Regression Models**: Worked on linear regression models based on multivariable analysis to simulate the unique computer science grading system at Del Norte.
- **Data Simulation**: Developed and trained linear regression models using a mock data simulator for effective analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: [[Link](https://github.com/rohinsood/cs-canvas-backend)]
